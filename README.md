Name: Pradheep Shanmugam
Tool Used: Power BI + MySQL
Project Type: Retail Analytics 
Domain: Shopping Malls


This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using data collected from 10 different shopping malls in Istanbul. The goal is to explore purchase trends by gender, age, category, and payment method between 2021 and 2023. Data was sourced from MySQL, cleaned and transformed, then visualized using Power BI for interactive insights.


Step 1: Data Understanding & Preparation
The dataset includes fields like invoice number, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity, price, payment method, invoice date, and shopping mall. Key preparation steps:
• Loaded raw data from MySQL database
• Cleaned nulls, removed duplicates
• Formatted dates and standardized categorical values
• Created calculated fields in Power BI such as Total Revenue = Quantity × Price
• Built relationships between tables for shopping malls, transactions, and products


Step 2: KPI Metrics & Dashboard Design
Top-level KPIs calculated:
• Total Revenue: ₺252M
• Total Sales: ₺69M (considered as net value of transactions)
• Total Quantity: 299K items sold
• Total Customers: 99K unique customers
DAX was used to build dynamic measures and KPIs that respond to year/payment filters.


Step 3: Gender-Based Analysis
To address:
1. Shopping Distribution by Gender:
   • Purchase quantity bar shows Female: 100%, Male: 67.2% => Females purchased more.
2. Which Gender Bought More:
   • Clothing category had the highest female participation (62K items).
3. Revenue by Gender:
   • Female Revenue: ₺150M (46.93%), Male Revenue: ₺101M (31.65%) – Females generated higher revenue.
   • Pie chart visual with DAX-calculated % revenue share helps clarify.
4. Category Purchases by Gender:
   • Cosmetics and Clothing were more preferred by females; Food & Beverage by males.

   
Step 4: Age-Based Analysis
6. Shopping Distribution by Age:
   • Line chart shows most revenue generated by customers between ages 25–40.
7. Age Group with Most Sales:
   • Highest quantity and consistent transaction volume in the 30–35 age range.
8. Age Group Revenue:
   • Peak revenue: Age 38 (~₺5.6M), and strong performance from ages 28–42.
9. Cross-category impact:
   • Younger groups focused more on Clothing & Cosmetics; older groups on Food & Beverage and Toys.

   
Step 5: Shopping Mall Performance
• Mall of Istanbul and Kanyon lead in total quantity sold (60K & 59K respectively).
• Lower footfall malls (e.g., Emaar, Forum, ViaPort) show consistent 15K sales, needing marketing intervention.
• Bar and line charts provide both quantity and sales by location.
• Helps guide resource allocation and promotional planning.


Step 6: Payment Method Impact
10. Payment Method Relationship:
   • Filters show variation in spending behavior across methods.
   • Cross-filtering indicates that younger customers prefer cards, while older customers lean toward cash.
11. Payment Method Distribution:
   • Majority payments via credit card, followed by cash and debit.
   • Payment method filter allows drill-throughs for segment-specific analysis.

   
Step 7: Interactivity and Features
• Year and Payment Method slicers for dynamic reporting.
• Scrollable and color-coded visuals (bar, donut, line, area charts).
• Gender toggle comparisons and category-specific breakdowns.
• All visuals are synchronized with filters to enhance storytelling and decision-making.


Step 8: Key Takeaways and Business Value
• Female customers dominate in quantity and revenue – target marketing accordingly.
• Age group 28–42 is most profitable – ideal for campaign segmentation.
• Clothing and Cosmetics categories drive major revenue.
• Mall performance insights can optimize location-wise resource distribution.
• Payment insights inform logistics, UX improvement, and offers.
